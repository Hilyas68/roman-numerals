# Code Challenge - Roman Numeral Converter

Use a Test Driven approach to write a converter that converts numbers into Roman Numerals

Rules: 

- Convert numbers into numerals using the following chart:

| Number | Numeral |
|--------|---------|
| 1      | I       |
| 5      | V       |
| 10     | X       |
| 50     | L       |
| 100    | C       |
| 500    | D       |
| 1000   | M       |

- Roman Numerals for 4 and 9 are written using subtractive notation, this means that the smaller numeral is subtracted from the larger. e.g. IV for 4 instead of IIII and IX for 9 instead if VIIII. 
- Subtractive notation is also used for 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and (900). These are all the subtractive notations.
- Using the above logic, next create a numeral to number converter which does the opposite. e.g. X -> 10

Ensure both positive and negative outcomes are covered by your tests.
